## Latex Preview Container

The inicial objective was to create a visual studio code extension that could build latex files and preview the PDF's "on-the-fly", directly in web ide. For now i think its not possivel o nteh web ide, because extensions like latex workshop are disable in that enverioment, so i supposed they need some extra binaries to work but the webide wont let them.

What i can do in the future is do a extension that will run locally in a devcontainer or simply try to reduce this repository devcontainer to the minimal files necessary to make this work.
